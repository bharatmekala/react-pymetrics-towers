## Inspiration

Out of sheer curiosity about how drag-and-drop works, I started checking out some new libraries (I chose to use React Beautiful DnD) to amp up user experiences. This coincided with my plan to put together my own Pymetrics Games site. I had this idea of adding a drag-and-drop feature, especially in a tower game, to make the whole user experience more engaging and interactive.

I also have a blog post reflecting my journey on this project, check out the blog [here](https://photkosee.github.io/hugo-blog/p/dnd/).

## What this does?

This project is one of the Pymetrics games which will present users with three towers, each one consisting of several colored disks stacked vertically, and a diagram displaying what all three towers should look like by the end of the assignment. Users will need to organize the disks according to the diagram using the least number of moves. Users can only move the top disk of the tower at a time, and only one disk can be changed place with each move.

> The Pymetrics games are a collection of 12 games designed to assess your personality traits and cognitive skills. The major challenge of the Pymetrics test is to understand what the desired outcome of each test is and what is being measured and scored.
