# Pymetrics Towers Game
> A game to make the towers match the target formation using as few moves and finishing as fast as possible. Visit the site [here](https://photkosee.github.io/react-pymetrics-towers/)

## Background
Driven by curiosity about the mechanics of drag-and-drop functionality, I embarked on a journey to explore new libraries that could elevate user experiences (with React Beautiful DnD). This exploration coincided with my plans to construct a [personalized Pymetrics Games site](https://github.com/photkosee/next-pymetrics-games), where I envisioned incorporating a drag-and-drop feature, particularly in a tower game, to enhance the overall user engagement and interaction.
