# Pymetrics Towers Game
> A game to make the towers match the target formation using as few moves and finishing as fast as possible. Visit the site [here](https://photkosee.github.io/react-pymetrics-towers/)

## Background
Out of sheer curiosity about how drag-and-drop works, I started checking out some new libraries (I chose to use React Beautiful DnD) to amp up user experiences. This coincided with my plan to put together my own Pymetrics Games site. I had this idea of adding a drag-and-drop feature, especially in a tower game, to make the whole user experience more engaging and interactive.

I also have a blog post reflecting my journey on this project, check out the blog [here](https://photkosee.github.io/hugo-blog/p/dnd/).
