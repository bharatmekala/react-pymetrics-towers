### Log

- 10/04/2024 New design

## Background

Out of sheer curiosity about how drag-and-drop works, I started checking out some new libraries (I chose to use React Beautiful DnD) to amp up user experiences. This coincided with my plan to put together my own Pymetrics Games site. I had this idea of adding a drag-and-drop feature, especially in a tower game, to make the whole user experience more engaging and interactive.

I also have a blog post reflecting my journey on this project, check out the blog [here](https://photkosee.github.io/hugo-blog/p/dnd/).

## What is Pymetrics Games

The Pymetrics games are a collection of 12 games designed to assess your personality traits and cognitive skills. The major challenge of the Pymetrics test is to understand what the desired outcome of each test is and what is being measured and scored.

## Feature

- A game matching all the blocks with the random pattern
